        <p>I like making the drawings because through drawing you can express various emotions, train of thoughts, and collective feelings. ... Through drawing you can express what you feel, what you want, your perception, etc. I try to make some new pictures in my spare time. Whenever I draw a picture, I love it. In my school also my teacher says that my drawing is best in the class and she also love my drawings. It increases my creativity, develops communication skills, improves holistic health, and much more!</p>

        <h1> Leonardo da Vinci <br>
            <h2>Leonardo da Vinci born on 15 April 1452, and died on 2 May 1519. He was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor and architect. While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he also became known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. Leonardo's genius epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works compose a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary, Michelangelo.</h2>
